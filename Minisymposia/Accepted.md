### Integrated time series analysis and machine learning to analyze dynamical complex systems

Machine Learning strategies have been hailed as an exceptional
approach for capture the local systems dynamics. Among other things,
it can be used for regression, out of it output for near future time
can be forecast. On the other hand, Nonlinear Time Series Analysis
comprises a set of robust strategies that can be used to characterize
dynamical behavior and even forecast dynamical changes. The
combination of both approaches may provide an outstanding and robust
tool to properly deal with complex systems, not only characterizing
them, but also to forecast dynamical changes, like tipping
points. This minisymposium aims to bring together experts in this area
to provide an state of art view about this new approach.

### Multistability and global stability analysis

Several dynamical systems are multistable: they exhibit a coexistence
of stable solutions, formally called attractors, with examples
including power grids, climate, the brain, and metabolic systems, to
name a few. Perturbations, such as noise or external shocks, can
induce such transitions between these attractors - which, depending on
the application, may be either desirable or catastrophic. It becomes
crucial therefore to study the stability in such multistable
systems. Typically stability is studied using local bifurcation
analysis and continuation, but this approach is limited and typically
unsuitable for real-world applications where perturbations are
finite-sized instead of infinitesimal. This calls for a global (or,
non-local) view of stability. Recent progress has enriched the
literature with various quantities that can be used as global
quantifiers of stability: basin stability, basin entropy, or other
indicators of so-called resilience like the width of the basin of
attraction or the minimal fatal shock. In this minisymposium we want
to highlight and promote recent research that focuses on global
stability analysis of multistable systems, multistability in
high-dimensional systems, and multistability in chaotic systems.

### Analysis and numerics of nonlinear dynamical systems

Nonlinear Dynamical Systems have been the vehicle for not only addressing important questions in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering, but also for understanding real-world phenomena therein. Those include gravity (governed by the General Theory of Relativity), Nuclear Physics and Quantum Mechanics (Quantum Field Theory), Atomic Physics (atomic Bose-Einstein Condensation and related phase transitions), and Fluid Mechanics (governed by the Euler/Navier Stokes equations). Mathematicians and Theoretical Physicists have been working both on the theory and analysis of the respective governing equations whose studies have been complemented by numerical computations. The latter usually go hand-in-hand not only with theory but also with experimental realizations of the pertinent phenomena modeled by nonlinear dynamical systems.

This session will focus on the analysis and numerical computations of nonlinear dynamical systems through a variety of techniques from a broad range of different mathematical/physical areas. On one hand, the topics that will be discussed are relevant to forefront research in General Relativity, Topological/Quantum Field Theories, Nonlinear Waves, Pattern Formation, Solitons and Topological Defects. On the other hand, techniques that will be presented include, among others, integrability, local and global well-posedness, asymptotics, stability, and state-of-the-art numerical computing. This session will bring together high caliber experts in the above areas and highlight some of the newest findings and emerging trends.

### Vegetation pattern formation

Vegetation pattern formation is a relatively new research field where concepts and tools of pattern formation theory are applied to problems at the forefront of ecological research. The interest in vegetation patterns has surged since their widespread discovery in many parts of the world and their description in terms of spatially explicit mathematical models about two decades ago. Vegetation patterns comprise large populations of plants - the primary producers that form the basal level of the whole food web. Studying vegetation patterns is, therefore, essential for understanding ecosystem response to climate change and how to secure the many services ecosystems provide to humans.

Vegetation patterning is a population-level response to environmental stress that involves partial mortality of the plant population. A common type of stress is water deficit in drylands, which occupy more than 40% of the terrestrial earth area, and in non-drylands subjected to severe droughts. Indeed, most observations of vegetation patterns have been reported in drylands. Other kinds of stress include low nutrient levels in wetlands, stress related to soil biota such as pathogens or toxic materials, grazing by herbivores, and others.

The aim of the proposed mini-symposium is to present recent advances and challenges in understanding the various mechanisms that drive vegetation patterning, the resulting pattern dynamics, and the implications for ecosystem functioning in stressed environments. The presentations will cover various dynamical behaviors, including stationary and traveling-wave patterns, multistability of uniform and patterned states, front propagation and instabilities, multi-scale patterns, etc. Methods of model analysis to be presented will include bifurcation theory, singular perturbation theory, numerical continuation, direct numerical simulations, and others.

### Dimensional reduction of chaotic dynamics

The proposed minisymposium aims at providing a bird’s-eye view of the
current methodologies used to extract the salient features of
high-dimensional, chaotic phase spaces, by means of an effective
dimensional reduction.  Understanding the dynamics of chaotic systems
with many degrees of freedom is nowadays central in several
disciplines spanning physics, engineering and biology, such as fluid
dynamics in the study of turbulence, weather science, but also
networks and wave dynamics, among others. Yet, direct numerical
simulations often prove impractical due the high dimensionality and
complexity of the state space, neither do they provide enough insight
on the dynamics, let alone allowing efficient and accurate estimates
of the relevant observables.  Dimensional reduction techniques come to
our rescue in this framework. The objective is that to determine an
effective manifold that captures the dynamics in its full, by
factoring out the symmetries of the flow, leveraging the compression
produced by dissipation, partitioning the state space by means of
unstable periodic orbits or other invariants, or transporting
densities via a linear transfer operator such as Koopman’s or
Perron-Frobenius’. These problems will be addressed by four of the
proposed talks both from a theoretical and an operational standpoint.
Describing the dynamics with a transfer matrix and reducing its
effective dimensionality to facilitate its spectral analysis is also
the topic of an additional lecture, in the context of network theory.
The development of tools for the dimensional reduction of chaotic
dynamics cannot ignore the state of the art of machine learning and
related technologies, which have already been assisting practitioners
in the recognition and computation of optimal Poincaré sections, or
highly non-trivial smooth-conjugacy transformations for flattening
convoluted neighborhoods, similarly to conformal mapping. This new
frontier in the investigation of high-dimensional chaos will be the
object of the remaining proposed reports.

### Non-structurally-induced collective (or akin to collective) behaviours in dynamical systems

The emergence of collective dynamical behaviours is a crucial topic for the understanding of the global evolution of systems, a task necessary to building predictable, controllable and robust ones, and finding efficient healthcare strategies. From power grids and laser dynamics to Parkinson and epidemic spreading, we are confronted in our everyday life to the difficulty of this task.
In many cases, the specific global behaviour of a given system is due to its underlying graph structure, but it is well-known now that the structure is not the only factor responsible of the global dynamics:
other factors can play a major role in its emergence, such as a particular coupling term, a noise, a delay term, etc., giving rise for instance to noise-induced stability or collective orders, and delay-induced clustering, among other phenomena.
The purpose of this minisymposium is to address several aspects of such collective (or akin to collective) behaviours of dynamical systems which are not, or not only, structurally induced.

### Stability, long term behaviour, and data assimilation in infinite dimensional stochastic systems for weather, climate, and ocean

Analysing the long term and ergodic behaviour of stochastic weather and climate models (including their fluctuations and their statistical response to parameter changes) has attracted great interest from mathematicians as well as physicists, also due to the relevance of these topics for the current climate crisis. It turns out that ideas from data assimilation play an important role in this analysis.

At the same time, effectively combining observations with dynamical models for the purpose of prediction and modelling (validation) has lead to exciting recent works at the interface of machine learning, analysis of PDEs, and data assimilation. Clarifying the long term properties of the developed approaches however remains a challenge and relies on an improved understanding of the long term behaviour of the underlying systems. This mini-symposium will bring together researchers in the fields of SPDE´s, Data Assimilation, Machine Learning and Climate Science interested in working at the intersection of these areas, to join forces in order to further our understanding of the aforementioned problems.

### Cyclic dynamical systems

 A significant progress in understanding of typical processes in multispecies ecological systems, as well as neural and cognitive networks, has been achieved using cyclic dynamical systems. The goal of the minisymposium is to present and discuss recent advances in that field. The talks include the description and analysis of heteroclinic networks, propagation of fronts, as well as the stability of spatially extended cyclic systems.

### Nonautonomous dynamical systems

Nonautonomous dynamical systems describe the qualitative behavior of
evolutionary differential and difference equations whose right-hand
side depends explicitly on time. The importance of nonautonomous
dynamical systems is illustrated by the fact that a significant number
of real-world applications are governed by time-dependent inputs, and
the traditional mathematical theory of dynamical systems fails to
address this. Weather phenomena associated to climate change such as
El Niño, the carbon cycle, and even the stock markets, are examples of
dynamical processes with a deep economic impact that require
sophisticated models to take nonautonomous influences in form of
changes of parameters into account.

The theory of nonautonomous dynamical systems has experienced a
renewed and steadily growing interest in the last twenty years. It is
the goal of this minisymposium to combine and explore recent
developments in both theory and applications that address the
understanding of phenomena in nonautonomous dynamical systems with
focus on bifurcation-theoretical questions.

### Nonlinear and stochastic dynamics in Earth system science

The Earth system is a highly complicated and complex system with
nonlinear interactions on multiple spatial and temporal scales among
multiple variables. Understanding the involved nonlinear and
conceptually stochastic processes and the fundamental complexity in
the Earth system is of great importance for better modeling,
predictions, and projections. Recent scientific progress has led to
the emergence of advanced approaches and theoretical developments in,
for example, nonlinear time series analysis, dynamical and stochastic
systems theory, causal inference, complex and neural networks, or the
role of tipping points for complex systems. These approaches have
demonstrated great potential to address general and specific problems
in environmental science.

In this mini-symposium we aim to bring together mathematicians and
environmental scientists to present recent research on the application
of mathematical methods that facilitate modern dynamical system theory
and stochastic approaches. We are looking forward to insighIul and
extensive discussions on the relevance and necessary modifications of
such approaches for Earth System science.

### Realization of connection structures in phase space

Complex systems in applications ranging from ecology to game theory display dynamic transitions between different (quasi-)invariant states. A well-known example are fluctuations of species abundancies in ecosystems. When more than two such states are present, not all transitions are necessarily possible and intriguing patterns may emerge in the connection structure. These transitions can be modeled e.g. as heteroclinic or excitable connections between (quasi-)invariant sets. Recent years have seen remarkable developments when it comes to realizing specific transition structures---given by a directed graph---as dynamical structures in the phase space of an ODE system. Oftentimes, additional restrictions are to be met: for instance, additional dynamical properties such as robustness or stability might be desirable for the connection structure. On the other hand, the class of vector fields in which the design takes place can be restricted for example by underlying symmetries or coupling structure.

This minisymposium brings together leading experts in the area of restricted design to discuss recent advances and to uncover potential future paths.

### Dynamics of reservoir computers

Reservoir computers (RCs) are dynamical systems that are capable of
computation and are becoming increasingly used in the areas of machine
learning (ML) and neuromorphic computing. While RCs are known for
outperforming other ML approaches with significantly less
computational expense, there are various other factors that fuel their
rising popularity. For instance, a RC’s dynamical nature facilitates
us to ‘open the black-box’ and explain the underlying dynamics behind
what permits learning, prevents learning, and produces unintended
functionalities. This dynamics-driven mindset also helps us to build a
bridge from the brain to new computing paradigms and to harness
properties of physical and dynamical systems in order to invent new
ways in which a machine can learn. This minisymposium showcases how
concepts from dynamical systems, neuroscience, quantum mechanics and
optics, such as generalised synchronisation, multifunctionality,
many-body quantum systems and time-delay, can be used to describe the
learning process of RCs, allows RCs to display a broader level of
intelligence by performing multiple tasks without altering its
structure, and obtain ultrafast information processing speeds in a
highly efficient and minimalistic manner.  The aim of this
minisymposium is to highlight that the area of reservoir computing
enables us to expand the capabilities of artificially intelligent
systems while also confronting the ‘explainability’ elephant in the
room.

### Lost and found: Searching for underlying dynamical relations in data using Machine Learning

Complex, dynamical systems are often comparatively easy to observe,
but exceedingly difficult to capture and understand theoretically. To
bridge the gap between theorized and observed dynamics, several data
analysis tools and data-driven models developed in Machine Learning
are now being applied to dynamical systems. For example,
physics-informed neural networks and universal differential equations
are two approaches in which (algebraic) knowledge of system dynamics
is combined with an unknown, black box function whose parameters can
be fit to data using gradient-based methods and learn to represent the
unknown dynamical relationships in the data. The
Sparse-Identification-of-Nonlinear-Dynamics regression framework
enables users to learn simple, algebraic dependencies in differential
equations from data on a system’s change over time. These tools
promise to support classical modeling when precise knowledge of the
system is lacking, but measurement data of the phenomenon of interest
is available.
 
However, can we always be certain that the learned relationships
reflect the full dynamics of the underlying system? How accurate are
predicted future dynamics of the systems? And what are the consequence
of such hybrid approaches for classical modeling of dynamical systems,
e.g. in fluid dynamics, population dynamics, ocean, and climate
modeling? Do we find or lose interactions and dynamics beyond what
classical modeling provides?
 
This minisymposium invites contributions, from all areas of science,
that apply machine learning to understand relationships between
dynamic state variables and forecast future dynamic behavior of a
system from data. We welcome both theoretical and applied work from a
wide range of scientific disciplines. With this minisymposium, we aim
to foster an interdisciplinary exchange about advantages and
disadvantages, limits, and opportunities in applying Machine Learning
to dynamical systems modeling and real-world modeling applications.

### Nonlinear dynamics in music perception and production

Recent advances in networked physiology and brain dynamics in music perception as well as noval approaches in music production like nonlinear physical modeling of musical instruments, human-machine interaction or ensemble playing arrive at complex networks representing music as a self-organizing adaptive system. The minisymposium is to present brain models and measurements, noninear dynamical models of musical instruments or larger systems including musicans interactions to also extend into social and cultural systems. Findings include brain representation of musical tension and large-scale form, rhythm perception and groove interactions, adaptation of tempo among ensemble play, temporal-lobe epilepsy estimation correlating musical semantics with brain dynamics or synchronization of brain regions corresponding to musical content. Also musical instrument tone production is discussed in terms of turbluence in wind instruments, bow-string interactions or the complex interplay of musical instruments and their environments. Enlarging dynamical models into societies or cultural phenomena are discussed. The minisymposium is about to give insight into fundamental concepts, recent developments and findings as well as future questions and implementations.

### Dynamics in energy systems - from analytics to machine learning

Modern power systems are tasked with incorporating increasing shares
of renewable energy sources. This ongoing drastic transformation is
crucial to mitigating the climate crisis but increases the complexity
of the energy systems and hence poses novel challenges to our
understanding of the collective dynamics of these complex systems,
including of power grids. Although the underlying equations have been
known for a long time, the treatment of such grids on the systems
level remains difficult, mainly due to their nonlinearities, distinct
heterogeneities in the dynamics of the nodes, and their interaction
topology, as well as the various kinds of perturbations and
fluctuations present. Additionally, power grids are embedded in and
interconnected to several other complex systems, such as electricity
markets, fluctuating consumers, heating and transport sectors. We
focus here on central challenges of decentralized and heterogeneous
power grids and ways to analyze and improve their stability.

### Nonequilibrium phase transitions and critical collective behavior in networks

Nonequilibrium phase transitions and critical collective behavior in
dynamical networks have recently attracted much attention. They are
often associated with synchronization transitions of various kinds,
giving birth to a plethora of synchronization patterns, and with
critical states between different stable regimes. Examples are tipping
transitions, noise-induced transitions, early warning signals,
explosive synchronization, bistability, hysteresis, phase coexistence,
nucleation, critical slowing down, critical fluctuations and
correlations, and critical exponents. Applications can be found in
many natural, socioeconomic, and technological systems, for instance,
in neuroscience, power grids, social networks, etc.

### Synchronization, pattern formation and symmetries in distributed dynamical systems

Many real-world dynamical systems display network structure consisting of interacting agents.
Due to the complex interaction topologies with corresponding distributed control laws and the resulting high dimensionality, the investigation of such coupled systems is challenging.
In particular, non-static interaction structure (e.g. time-dependent or state-dependent coupling) as well as symmetries induced by the underlying network structure cause issues.
Examples of systems with varying topologies range from neuroscience (active and inactive communication channels) over epidemiology (time-dependent social interactions allow for transmissions) to distributed computing (individual mobile agents
communicate only when they are in each others vicinity).
Difficulties arise on multiple sides: On the one hand, the dynamics of each interacting agent may be complicated (e.g. non-smooth). But on the other hand, structural properties such as symmetries may vary and have to be taken into account.
In the analysis of distributed dynamical systems in terms of synchronization, pattern formation, and symmetries, these problems come together and require combined methods from network dynamics, geometric optimization, distributed computing, and graph theory.

### Dynamical systems in mathematical biology: Insights into disease modeling and mathematical analysis

In the field of mathematical biology, disease modeling utilizes mathematical frameworks to simulate
and understand the dynamics of infectious diseases within populations. The integration of stability
analysis and bifurcation theory is pivotal in unraveling the complexities of these models, offering crucial
insights into the stability of equilibria and qualitative transformations that underpin disease dynamics,
thereby advancing our knowledge of epidemiological phenomena. This mini-symposium aims to delve
into the dynamical systems of disease models by combining modeling, bifurcation theory, and stability
analysis. Researchers and practitioners are invited to contribute expertise on disease dynamics via
various mathematical models, including both ordinary and partial differential equations. To emphasize
the exploration of bifurcation phenomena, investigations into the qualitative changes induced by
varying parameters are encouraged. Moreover, contributions that focus on stability analysis techniques
to unravel the stability properties of disease equilibria and periodic solutions are welcomed. Through
presentations and discussions, the mini-symposium aims to foster collaboration among
interdisciplinary participants, facilitating the exchange of ideas and advancing our understanding of
disease dynamics.

### Turbulence, nonequilibrium,  and wind energy

Turbulence is one of the major challenge of nonlinear science. It does not only play a crucial role for fundamental research but also for many applications. A very timely topic is the use of wind energy, as the energy resource, i.e. strong wind, is by its own nature highly nonlinear and turbulent. In the application one is typically confronted with many aspect of non ideal turbulent conditions. Thus besides the deeply elaborated homogeneous isotropic turbulence questions like nonequilibrium and non stationary turbulence attract more and more interest, as well as the transition to developed turbulence. In particular in the interaction of turbulence and wind energy systems the concepts of nonlinear dynamics become important to handle this complex system.

### Non-autonomous dynamics in complex systems: theory and applications to biological, ecological, and climate systems

This minisymposium will discuss novel theoretical and data-driven methods to
characterize non-autonomous dynamics. We present several examples of non-
autonomous dynamics from different research areas in biology, particularly
neuroscience and ecosystem dynamics as well as climate science. Neuronal
systems, ecosystems as well as the climate system can be considered as
interaction networks which are influenced by external time-dependent drivers
like external stimuli in neuroscience. Changes in environmental conditions for
ecosystems and the climate system are impacted by the climate crisis.

### Reaction networks

Reaction networks play a pivotal role in fundamental biochemical processes such as metabolism, cell-signaling, and cell-regulation. However, tackling the complexities of these networks poses tremendous challenges, encompassing network-reconstruction, parameter-fitting, and dynamical analysis. Consequently, it is not surprising that reaction networks are addressed with a diverse array of tools from various disciplines and many fields of mathematics ranging from dynamical systems to algebraic geometry.
Unfortunately, there is still a limited cross-disciplinary exchange among researchers in different fields. This limitation impedes significant progress in comprehending these central structures. With this motivation, the minisymposium aims to bring together experts from different fields of mathematics and the natural sciences, all sharing a common interest in reaction networks. The overarching goal is to facilitate an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas, methods, perspectives, and questions, fostering collaboration that can propel advancements in understanding the dynamics of these intricate systems.

### Energy transfers in atmosphere and ocean

The concept of an energy budget for the Earth serves as a powerful sanity check for consistency with fundamental physical principles, and indeed climate models still exhibit energetic inconsistencies whereby energy either vanishes or is created from nowhere.  Due to the immense size and complexity of the Earth system, approximations for the energy transfer throughout the scales of the atmosphere and ocean must be made, and it is here that these inconsistencies arise.  The TRR 181 is an interdisciplinary research group of meteorologists, oceanographers and mathematicians working to develop physically consistent approximations for the phenomena which transfer energy through these scales, including turbulence, gravity waves, ocean/atmosphere coupling, and more.  By implementing these improved approximations in existing Earth system models, we enhance climate analysis and forecast accuracy.

We tackle this problem on many fronts: with theoretical mathematicians investigating fundamental issues such as well-posedness of fluid flows and chaotic dynamics, with numerical analysts investigating robustness and spurious mixing, and with oceanographers and meteorologists providing physical insight and experimental observations.

### Patterns of synchrony in complex networks

Networks of coupled nonlinear units are relevant in many fields of
physics, chemistry and biology, and constitute a fascinating area of
research in nonlinear science. They are paradigmatic models of complex
systems, being intensively studied nowadays. One of the most famous
phenomenon described by these models is synchronization, which
manifests itself in the form of various spatio-temporal patterns in
different natural systems. Understanding the mechanisms underlying
synchronization and the resulting collective behaviors is essential
for predicting and controlling the dynamics of these systems. The aim
of this minisymposium is to discuss the most recent developments and
tendencies in the field. The topics covered will include (but will not
be limited to) synchronization in neuronal ensembles, pattern
formation in networks of coupled oscillators and networks of excitable
units, and the mathematical methods used to analyze these phenomena.

### Quantum simulation and computation at the edge of chaos

The goal of medium-to-large scale quantum computation, a stage when the number of entangled qubits reaches quantum advantage where quantum processors are more efficient than classical computers, opens a broad spectrum of new challenges. These range from technological issues related to the preparation, protection and manipulation of highly entangled many-body states, to the need to improve computational algorithms that solve actual practical problems.

Here one important question refers to the interplay between entanglement growth vs. Hilbert space localization. Growing quantum correlations enable to exploit the advantages that entanglement brings into computation, with the closely related exploration of the set of computational states, relevant for dynamical control. These dynamical aspects clash with mechanisms that spread or delocalize quantum states outside of the subspace of computational states. Interestingly, the competition between fast scrambling, related to classical chaos, and localization has been the subject of quantum chaos where this dichotomy appeared in the form of the transition from integrability to chaos. In low-dimensional systems early seminal developments addressed this problem within the framework of asymptotic semiclassical analysis linking quantum mechanical amplitudes with classical phase space and the notion of chaos and integrability.

With the advent of experimentally realizable quantum simulators and corresponding advances in the control of many-body states, quantum chaos has again moved into the focus now addressing complex quantum systems with large number of degrees of freedom. This subject of many-body quantum chaos has provided the theoretical framework for studying the interesting competition between scrambling and localization.

In this Minisymposium we attempt to take a fresh look on this timely subject. The idea is to discuss aspects of the coexistence between fast scrambling and integrability as essential ingredients of quantum simulators, and to identify new physical concepts in the largely unexplored field of many body quantum chaos in quantum simulators.

### Modeling, analysis, and control of cardiac dynamics

This mini-symposium deals with current aspects of the non-linear
dynamics of the heart. Top- ics range from signal analysis for the
diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation),
simulation and control of (chaotic) excitation dynamics in the
myocardium and methods to terminate life-threatening ventricular
fibrillation (low-energy defibrillation) to new methods of machine
learning for the analysis and data-driven modeling of complex
spatio-temporal data (e.g., from optical mapping or ultrasound).

The speakers come from theoretical and experimental basic research as
well as clinical applications. We, therefore, expect that this
mini-symposium will not only be a platform for the exchange of current
research results but will also lead to new collaborations between the
par- ticipating researchers and research areas that will address
current and future medical needs using novel concepts from data
analysis and dynamical systems theory.

### Nonlinear and stochastic dynamics in weather and climate science

The dynamics of the atmosphere, the ocean and the climate system as a whole are complex, nonlinear, and encompass a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Reduced-order descriptions of coarse-grained variables are naturally stochastic due to the uncertainties relating to inevitable parametric and structural errors in weather and climate models as well as unresolved scales and processes. This minisymposium is centred around nonlinear and stochastic analysis and modelling of atmospheric, oceanic and climate phenomena; it aims at bringing together experts reporting on latest developments in these areas. This includes, for example, prediction and predictability, subgrid-scale parameterization, reduced-order models, extreme events and critical transitions; strategies may range from physics-based modelling to data-driven approaches using advanced statistics and machine learning techniques to hybrid modelling. While the applications are motivated in and geared towards weather and climate science, the discussed methodologies are relevant more generally for complex dynamical systems.

### Stability and Bifurcations of Hamiltonian Systems. Theory and Applications

Hamiltonian systems constitute a significant class within dynamical
systems, boasting numerous applications across various domains. In
this mini-symposium, our goal is to incorporate some of the latest
theoretical techniques and applications in this field, mainly
regarding with the stability of solutions (equilibria, periodic and
quasi-periodic solutions, and other related manifolds). Normally the
stability character of these solutions depend on various parameters
the Hamiltonian function depends upon, and varying these parameters
lead to bifurcations of the solutions. The stability character (linear
and non-linear) and the corresponding bifurcations are known for
Hamiltonian systems up to two degrees of freedom but the analysis to
higher degrees is far from trivial.  We will explore topics such as
the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem, non-linear stability theory
for exponentially long times, geometric approaches based on symplectic
reduction of the symmetries the equations enjoy, and different types
of normal forms either of local or global nature. We plan to deal with
recent approaches concerning the theoretical aspect of stability and
bifurcation theory, but also with an eye to applications in celestial
mechanics or atomic physics.

### Holomorphic Dynamics

The theory of discrete holomorphic dynamical systems is the mathematical study of the iteration of holomorphic mappings on complex manifolds. This now-classical subject traces its origins back to the pioneering work of Fatou and Julia in the late 1910s on the iteration of rational maps on the Riemann sphere. The subject gained increased attention in the 1980s, partly due to the emergence of computer-generated images, and has remained very active since then. It has grown into a large area with broad connections to other branches of mathematics, such as algebra, analysis, geometry, measure theory, and number theory. The aim of this minisymposium is to present recent developments on diverse aspects of the subject and to foster collaborative discussions among participants.
