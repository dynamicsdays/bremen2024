% Location

The conference is located on the park-like campus of Constructor
University in the North of Bremen.  It offers comfortable on-campus
full-board accommodation and many facilities to meet and discuss.
Lecture rooms, conference halls, campus housing, and recreational
facilities are all in close proximity, ensuring an excellent
environment not only for the structured conference program, but also,
in particular, for intense discussions, networking, and collaborative
work.

The event will be embedded in the local research arena with two
universities and several research institutes which engage in strong
and diverse dynamical systems research, ranging from marine and
climate research, medical modeling, to differential equations and
ergodic theory.
