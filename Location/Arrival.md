### Directions from Bremen central railway station to Constructor University

* **The commuter railway line RS1 which connects the conference site with the city center has been closed for track repairs on short notice for the entire time period of the conference.** There is a bus replacement service ([schedule here](https://download.transdev.de/transdev/uploads/nwb/schedule/1505227/rs-1-22-06-bis-04-08-2024-ersatzfahrplan.pdf)) which departs from Bus Bay R hidden between the Best Western Hotel and the Cinemaxx (Hugo-Schauinsland-Platz). Constructor University is near the stop Bremen-Schönebeck (follow Bruno-Bürgel-Straße for about 5 min until you reach the Constructor University main gate).
* Alternatively, take the RS2 train and get off at Bremen-Burg (first stop). From Bremen-Burg you can still catch the replacement bus, marked SEV in the direction of Vegesack/Farge, or catch the 94 bus and get off at Taunusstraße where there is a back entrance to campus (needs a key, but it's very likely there will be staff/students getting off the same bus, too).

### Directions from Bremen Vegesack to Constructor University

* From Bremen-Vegesack, take the Bus 94 in the direction of Marßel. Get off at Seefahrtstraße, walk a few steps forward and turn left on Bruno-Bürgel-Straße. After about 300 meters you will reach the Constructor University main gate.

### Directions from Bremen Airport to Bremen central railway station

* From Bremen Airport take Tram 6 to Bremen Hauptbahnhof (central railway station).
* Cabs are of course also available.

### Public transport tickets

* If you stay on campus, the most economic way is to buy separate one-way tickets (€ 3.00 each) or a book of four one-way tickets (€ 11,20).  Note that individual tickets are time-stamped when you buy them.  Tickets from a book of four need to be time-stamped - for the RS1/RS2 on the station platform, for trams and buses also on board.
* If you stay off-campus, you might want to get a one-week pass (€ 25,40)
* Ticket machines are located at the airport tram station, all railway stations, and on board of the trams
* Select Tariff Zone 1 ("Preisstufe I")
* Paying by credit card or mobile phone is possible
* There are no ticket machines on board of the suburban railway trains from Bremen central to Bremen-Vegesack.  You risk being fined if you board these trains without a ticket.
* Tickets are valid all the way from Bremen airport to Bremen-Vegesack, you don't need to buy separate tickets

### Parking

* There are a number of designated parking areas, identified on the [Campus map](https://constructor.university/sites/default/files/2023-04/CU_Campus_Map_EN_2022_02.pdf)
* Parking on campus is free of charge
* Note: the entire campus area is a reduced-traffic zone, and motorists must stick to the designated routes and speed limits
